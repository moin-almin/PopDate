PROBLEM ADDRESSED
</h2>
<p id='problem-para'>
In a country like India, where relationships are considered something serious, and people seek more for compatibility than anything else, thus there is a need for some system where people are paired on some parameter rather than just profile picture.
</p>

<h2 id='solution'>
OUR SOLUTION
</h2>
<p id='solution-para'>
Our idea is to match people based on their common interest such as music taste, books they love, or their favourate movie genre, rather than swiping left and right based on other person's looks, coz let's be honest "Looks can be deceiving" however the preference and taste of a person speaks more about the person than his/her bio itself.

So for this prototype version, we have set movie genre as a parameter to pair up users of opposite gender. Since this is an early prototype, we have assumed our users are straight and are either Male or Female. We by no means mean any disrespect for anyone, just as an early prototype, we decided to keep the app as simple as possible.

TECH STACK 
</h2>
We have used the following tech stack to create our app :- 
<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>Node</li>
<li>Express.js</li>
<li>MongoDB</li>
<li>Mongoose</li>
<li>EJS</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='steps'>
RUNNING LOCALLY
</h2>
Follow the following steps in the order given :- 
<ol>
<li>Clone the entire repository using the command inside the terminal <br><br><i><b>git clone "https://github.com/moin-almin/PopDate"</b></i><br><br><b>Note that</b> for this step to work you need to have git cli installed in your local machine. If you don`t have it, you can either download it or instead download the zip file of the code from the github site by clicking on the above link</li>
<li>Once you have the files in your local machine, the next step is to check whether or not you have node installed in your machine or not. To check it, type the following command in the terminal<br><br><i><b>node --version</b></i><br><br>If you get as output the current version of your node, this implies that node is installed in your machine, however incase you get some error message, this implies node is not installed in your machine, which you can easily install from the internet.</li>
<li>Once ensuring that we have node installed in our machine, the next step is to run the app. In order to run the app, write the following command into our terminal<br><br><i><b>node app.js</b></i><br><br>This will start our server locally, and we can access it from the browser by typing in the url <br><br><b><i>localhost:8000</i></b> <br><br>However in the terminal the url of the app will be displayed, so no need to worry if it doesn't work on this app.</li>
</ol>
